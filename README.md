# Git Course Repository - DEPI Initiative

Welcome to the **Git Course Repository**! This repository contains two labs created as part of the Git course for the **DEPI Initiative**. The labs are designed to help learners understand the core concepts of version control using Git, including branching, tagging, and collaboration through GitHub.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub
- Set up Git on your local machine.
- Create a new Git repository.
- Understand basic Git commands (e.g., `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`).
- Push changes to a remote GitHub repository.
- Work with branches and learn how to merge them.

### Lab 2: Working with branching and Tags in Git
- create two branches
- create a file from these branches and push it
- merge changes to the master branch
- Delete branches locally `git branch -d <branch_name>` and remotely `git push origin :<branch_name>`.
- Create lightweight and annotated tags to mark specific commits.
- List all tags in a repository using the `git tag` command.
- Delete tags locally `git tag -d <tag_name>` and remotely `git push origin :<tag_name>`.
- Push tags to a remote repository.
- Manage tag deletions from both local and remote repositories.
